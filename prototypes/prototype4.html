			Usually games only have one winner, but why does this needs to be the case? Why could there not just be one loser? Those were the thoughts of the Vikings, and also the thoughts behind our fourth prototype. We were challenged with making a multiplayer, board game with only one losing player and some sort of resource management.

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>The result is “The Corridor”, a horror-inspired game for up to four players. In this game, players must escape a horde of zombies, but as only one player needs to die for the others to survive, the game highly encourage backstabbing and teaming up. The following sections further examines the element of backstabbing in the game, and aims at discussing the pros and cons of such a mechanic.</p>

				<h3>Backstabbing</h3>
				<p>Let’s start by discussing why backstabbing is interesting in the first place. When it comes to games, it is rare that the current play session, which one may be participating in, is going to have influence on player relationships. Once the game is over, anything that has happened is quickly forgotten, because after all it is “just a game”. Therefore, unlike real life, backstabbing another player in a game might break the bond between those two players, but only for the play session. You don’t risk losing a friendship, but only a partner for the rest of the game. This makes it much more accessible for players to utilize, and is therefore a common tactic for some.</p>
				<p>Backstabbing also adds a level of excitement to the game, as you are never sure who to trust. It is somewhat of a thrill to know that in two minutes you will completely ruin the game for another player, gaining you an advantage, and why it may not be fun for the player getting backstabbed, it is often an amusing act to witness for the rest of the table (which may explain the popularity of reality shows such as “Paradise Hotel”. Part of this excitement is also due to the gambling aspect. Once you reveal your true intentions, all cards are on the table. You must surely hope that the player you betrayed will not be able to retaliate, because there is no doubt that you are their number one priority for revenge.</p>
				<p>In “The Corridor”, we try to experiment with this backstabbing mechanic. The clearest example of this is the movement for the zombies. As explained in the ruleset, players can choose to spend an action point on either adding or subtracting to the number of rows the zombies will move on a given turn. Because players may be in very different positions on the board, they usually have different desires for the zombies: while some players would like them to slow down, others see the opportunity of sacrificing a friend. The possibility of saving a player (by playing a “Distract”-card) encourages players to team up throughout the game, which further adds to the possibility of backstabbing occurring.</p>
				<p>The design of the playing field should also influence the frequency of betrayal. Some of the corridor cards may only have room for one player to walk through at a time. This will pit players against each other, competing for who can take the lead and gain an advantage. Together with the trip and push cards, players will be interacting a lot which each other, and may sometimes be forced to leave a friend behind for their own sake.</p>

				<h3>Pitfalls</h3>
				<p>As we described above, backstabbing is one of the most important mechanics of the game. However, there is not always a guarantee for players to be in a “mood of betrayal”. For instance, what happens if everyone simply starts to work together? To force players into backstabbing, you need to put them into a position where they must decide between making the chance of winning less for themselves or someone else. Because the goal of most games is to win, this will lead to players having to put their own good first. If these decisions do not occur, there will be no conflict, and the game will become boring. In “The Corridor”, players could actually try to play as a team and see how far they can make it. We tried to balance the game so the zombies would eventually catch up to the players, but to make sure this happen, we thought about making the zombies move faster and faster as time goes on. However, play testing showed that it was close to impossible for players to escape all together, and thus eventually one would have to be left behind, hopefully leading to a choice between who to save or sacrifice.</p>

				<h3>Balancing</h3>
				<p>The final section will focus on balancing the game among the players. In most competitive multiplayer games, there is usually only one winner. These means that even if three out of four players would team up against the last one, they would eventually have to fight internally, and therefore quickly split the team up again. Yet, since our game is a Viking game and only have one loser, it would be much more common to see this happen in this case. Because you are potentially having three winners (players, who do not lose) in the game, there would actually be an advantage in singling out one player to team up against. The best way to counter this is giving the victims of backstabbing an advantage. This could be an extra move, additional powers, or something else. So if one player is tripped three times in the same round, they would be extra powerful in the following round (if they survived). One of the best examples of creating this balance is in the Mario Kart-series, where players, who are currently losing the race, gets access to much more powerful weapons, and are thus able to catch up. We could have tried doing something similar, where being the closest one to the zombies would give you an “adrenaline boost”, and let you jump twice as far. This could become a huge advantage in some situation, and would therefore mean other players would have to think twice before targeting one survivor.</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>Even though it was somewhat of a struggle to come up with a game where only one player loses, we think that “The Corridor” lived up to the challenge. The game requires backstabbing for the play experience to be entertaining, but we feel like the design choices we have made helps push players in the right direction. Running away from communist zombies with your friends is always a thrill, but tripping one of them and see their face when you just made them lose the game is hilarious.</p>
