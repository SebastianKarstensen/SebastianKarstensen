			For the second prototype, each group had to design a playground. We were asked to focus on the context, props, and pace of the design. Our idea was a food-themed playground, where each section was inspired by a specific category of food items.

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-8">
				<p>We gave one example of a section: the “Tropical Food”-section. This area would be focused around fruits from South America and Africa, in a jungle-themed setting. There would be a lot of trees and plants that were climbable, together with rock-climbing walls. We had the idea of filling each section with food, which the participants can then use to facilitate their own kind of play (think baseball with baguettes and apples). In this section, we wanted fruits to be hanging off the branches of the trees, so one would have to climb to the top collect it if they wanted to play with it. This would allow anyone to express themselves using the food however they want.</p>

				<p>The main attraction of the “Tropical Food”-section is the monkey. Being a giant structure in the middle of the area, the belly would be constructed to be perfect for landing on from high places. It would be filled with slides, and the fur would be climbable. Simulating the food that the monkey had ate, a ball pit would replace the inside of the stomach.</p>

				<h3>Influence of Food</h3>
				<p>Creating a playground is very much a task of giving possibilities to participants, but simultaneously limiting their freedom. Having too many options can be overwhelming, so it is important to make something that play can be structured around. By narrowing down the overall theme to be focused on food, it gives us as designer a limited scope to work from, and helps us set these limitations. We can also get inspired by other elements related to the fruit (for example, the tropical section brought life to the idea of a giant monkey). </p>
				<p>When using a specific overarching theme, it is important to live up to people’s expectations. Certain elements signify special properties, and if the playground does not live up to these hopes, the illusion is taken away from the players. One would probably expect the monkey to have fur that was tough and climbable, but had it been made out of hard plastic it would lose it values of immersing you in the play. Therefore, we must put extra focus on these challenging when designing a playground around a specific theme.</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>Prototyping a context for players to be able to interpret themselves, but still give them the framework to structure their own play, can be a massive task. The possibilities are limitless, so choosing a specific theme as a base for the design will help narrow the scope. However, this does lead to challenges regarding the immersion of the playground, so one must be extra aware of what decisions they make regarding materials and props in the playground.</p>
