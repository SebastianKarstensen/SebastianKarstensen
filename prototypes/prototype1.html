			The first prototype tasked us with developing a concept for a sport. Our work led to the invention of “Ñavas”, a team-based, water sport with influence from lacrosse and handball. As players fight for a chance to score the ball in the opponents’ net, they must also do their best to stay on the playing field – a platform suspended 1 meter above a pool of water. By using the certified equipment, players can push each other into the water, giving their own team a temporary advantage by outnumbering the opposing team until the fallen player returns to the play area. Generally, the sport aims to be very fast-pace and have a high level of intensity. This essay will go into detail with some specific elements of the sport, and examine what impact they have had on the design decision made in the development process.

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-8">
				<p>We start by studying sports in general. It is clear that sports belong in the category of games that Caillois describes as agon – games that heavily rely on skills and strength, and always have a declared winner and loser. However, sports also seem to be defined by their context. In contrast to play, sports are usually constructed for the spectators’ enjoyment as well. It is not unlikely that most sports started off as simple games aimed at entertaining the players, but has then been carved into the competitive competitions we see today through addition of rules and structure. Once a game has reached a certain level of popularity, requiring tournaments and leagues for finding the best players, it is easier to classify it as a sport. A perfect example of this are eSports; competitive video games, which are now so popular that people can play for a living. A sport is therefore not solely defined by its rules and mechanics, but also by its popularity and audience engagement.</p>

				<p>Based on our findings, we came up with a set of goals for what our sport should be. This helped us tremendously when we later had to make decisions regarding the design of almost every aspect of the game. By defining the intended outcome of the design process in the beginning, we could easily determine whether a specific decision would get us closer to what we intended, or if it worked against the “guidelines” we had set for ourselves. Since we defined one of the most important elements of a sport to be the spectators, we will dive deeper into the role of the audience.</p>

				<h3>Spectators</h3>
				<p>Even though swimming is both an exhausting and skillful activity, there is no denying that the water element of the sport is aimed toward pleasing the crowd. Gameshows such as “Wipeout” and “American Gladiator” have shown how humans find it entertaining to see others get pushed off platforms and fall into pits of cold water. The playing field could simply have been a flat surface, in which some areas had been colored differently to mark off zones of restriction. If a player was to touch this zone, they could be fined with a time penalty instead of having to swim back to the ladder and climb the platform, but the water adds to the entertainment value. By elevating the platform, players are unable to see exactly what is happening on the field when swimming in the water. That way, the spectators are also able to know what happens while the fallen players don’t. To make sure the audience is able to follow the play both in and out of the water, the facilities for the sports needs to be built around it. The impact on the design is described in the next section.</p>

				<h3>Setting</h3>
				<p>Given the uniqueness of the playing field, combined with the specialized equipment, this is not what one would call a “playground sport”. Very specific areas would need to be built to accommodate the design. Similar to many other water sports, an indoor location would be preferable, and elevated seats would be required so the audience are able to see the play on the platform. It may be possible to create lighter versions of the play area, for training on non-professional level. For example, a floating platform made of foam could be used in a standard swimming pool as an alternative. Overall, this sports needs a very specific setting, not only for the players, but also for the spectators.</p>

				<p>In a game where pushing is involved, safety is always an issue. We wanted the sport to be very physical and Gladiator-like, but we did not want it to be dangerous. Therefore, one of our first focus areas were designing the stick. In lacrosse, you experience a lot of contact between the sticks and the players, but you are also wearing proper equipment. As players sometimes would have to be swimming, we were limited in the amount of safety gear we could put on the players, and we also wanted to keep the focus on pushing (not hitting). We came up with the idea of foam padding the middle of the stick, and added the rule that players can only push each other’s sticks. This would hopefully lead to some intense one-on-one battles, which would still be safe for players to engage in.</p>
				<p>We chose not to have any specific player roles because it adds to the tactical elements of the game. Previously seen in sports like indoor football, not specifying roles will let players change on the fly and add to the pace of the game. This could mean that the role of being a goalie needs to be communicated throughout the team, but also gives an advantage in being able to let whoever is the closest to the goal take over the role. As we defined sports to be something you can practice and improve on, it is no doubt that skilled teams will be much better at utilizing the lack of a specified goalie. We also wanted the sport to be open to interpretation, in the sense that the mechanics should afford players freedom to develop different strategies. In handball, teams have the possibility of switching out the goalie for another player to outnumber the defense when attacking. Roles make the sport easier for players to get into and understand, as it limits their possibilities, but not having roles allow more tactics to be developed. This of course adds to the complexity of the game, which in turn makes it more difficult to learn the game.</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>"Ñavas" is a sport created with focus on the spectators. Even though it is both physically tough and requires skill to play, the design of the setting and equipment has been build around making a sport that will keep the crowd watching. As a sport it might fail, but as entertainment we are sure it will be great.</p>
