					<img class="project-image" src="prototypes/images/prot-1-playing-field.jpg" width="100%">
					<p class="project-description">The first prototype tasked us with developing a concept for a sport. Our work led to the invention of “Ñavas”, a team-based, water sport with influence from lacrosse and handball. As players fight for a chance to score the ball in the opponents’ net, they must also do their best to stay on the playing field – a platform suspended 1 meter above a pool of water.</p>

					<p class="project-description">For the second prototype, each group had to design a playground. We were asked to focus on the context, props, and pace of the design. Our idea was a food-themed playground, where each section was inspired by a specific category of food items.</p>

					<p class="project-description">Usually games only have one winner, but why does this needs to be the case? Why could there not just be one loser? Those were the thoughts of the Vikings, and also the thoughts behind our fourth prototype. We were challenged with making a multiplayer, board game with only one losing player and some sort of resource management. </p>

					<p class="project-description">The fifth prototype was the beginning of the final project of the course. Our task was to prototype the core loop of our game, to get an initial feeling of whether our idea could create the player experience we wanted. After a few failed prototypes, we settled on the game of “JuiceBoost”.</p>
